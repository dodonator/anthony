# anthony (WIP)

A bullet journal implementation in python using yaml files.

With anthony you can organize your **a**ppointments, **n**otes and **t**asks using an console interface. For each day a page is generated, which contains your appointments, notes and tasks for that day. Pages are stored using yaml files in subdirectories named after the current year. Using the CLI you can add new items to the current page, complete, cancel or post pone tasks and save notes. For each task you complete one karma point is generated and added to your karma count. Each task you cancel or post pone subtracts one karma point. You can render you current page as an markdown file.
